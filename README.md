# Weather Monitoring PI

This is a project that logs the temperature using a DHT22.

It's a WIP.

Planning to plot on a nicer graph and make it interactive.

# Usage
The main server runs on FLASK, and it displays the webpage.
There's a image in the wepage that is generated by the logger.
The logger runs every 30 minutes using a cron job.

There needs to be a directory made for the logs which contains log.csv, for the temp logs, and errors.txt for errors.
